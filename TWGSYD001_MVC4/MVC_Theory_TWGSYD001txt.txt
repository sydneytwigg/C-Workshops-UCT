1.	Which namespace do you need to include when writing asynchronous code?

		using System.Threading.Tasks

2.	In which types of situations are asynchronous applications most useful?

		When many tasks are executed simulataneously.

5.	Which method of dealing with concurrency scenarios is not supported by EF?

		Pessimistic currency control, AKA locking

6.	Optimistic concurrency means allowing concurrency conflicts to happen, and then reacting appropriately if they do. Describe the default action if you don’t do any coding to handle this.

			Making a database table for each entity class
		Table-per-concrete
			Map all non-abstract types to individual tables
