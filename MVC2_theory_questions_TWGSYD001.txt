	- GET - a method to send information from the browser to the server - GET appends the values being submitted to the URL

The database context keeps track of whether entities in memory are in sync with their corresponding rows in the database, and this information determines what happens when you call the SaveChanges method.

	- Members of EntityState enumeration:
		- Added
		- Deleted
		- Detatched
		- Modified
		- Unchanged

		     - returns a view from the database
