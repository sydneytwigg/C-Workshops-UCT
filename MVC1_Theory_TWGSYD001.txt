QUESTION 1
There are three ways you can work with data models and databases in the Entity
Framework. Name and briefly describe each way.

Answer:
- Code first
  - All database activity can be done using the code - if you don't have a database
   you are able to code classes and properties corresponding to tables and columns.
   If you do have a database, the entity framework tools can generate the properties
   and classes that correspond to the existing tables and columns.
- Database first
  - If you have an existing database, Entity Framework can automatically generate
  a data model with classes and properties corresponding to the existing database
  objects.
- Model first
  - If you don't have a database, you can create a model in Entity Framework and
  have it create the database using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.

QUESTION 2
For model entity classes the Entity Framework can automatically interpret a
property as the primary key. What naming patterns can you use to do this?
Which is preferable, and why?

Answer:
The convention to detect primary keys is:
- 'Id'
- [type name]Id

The preferred convention is 'Id' as it follows traditional database naming.

QUESTION 3
The Entity Framework discovers the database connection using a class derived
from DbContext. This derived class will call one of the constructors on the
base DbContext class. Briefly differentiate between the three Code First
approaches to do this.

Answer:
- Connection by convention
  - If you have no configuration and run a parameterless constructor for
  DbContext - it will run in Code First mode and will use the namespace
  name of your context class.
- Connection by convention and specified database name
  - If you have no configuration, but have a string constructor on DbContext,
  DbContext will run in Code First mode and will create a connection using the
  String constructor as the database name.
- Connection string in app.config/web.config file
  - You can add a connection string in your web.config/app.config to tell
  DbContext to use a database other than the defaults of Code First
  (SQL Express or LocalDb).

QUESTION 4
The Entity Framework can automatically drop and re-create a database for
How else can you handle model changes?

Answer:
- Dropping the database causes the loss of all data stored. Model changes can
  be handled in production can be done using Code First Migration without
  dropping the database.

QUESTION 5
Conventions are sets of rules that are used to automatically configure a
conceptual model based on class definitions when working with Code First.
Which other approaches can be used to further configure your model?

Answer:
  - Built-in conventions
  - Custom conventions
  - Model conventions

QUESTION 6
Microsoft continuously develops the MVC framework. What (exact) version of MVC
is your web application using? Where in your project did you find this
information?

Answer:
- 5.2.4.0
- web.config file
